Liyin He started as a graduate student in 2016. She worked on the impact of water stress on photosynthesis using a combination of remote sensing products. Her special focus was on agriculture and she was partially funded as a Resnick Fellow. Her main body of work included the tracking of water-stress modulated seasonal cycles of photosynthessi [@he2020tracking], the quantification of agricultural productivity in the corn belt [@he2020ground], the evaluation of trends in global Gross Primary productivity [@he2022remote], and the evaluation of the impact of air poluution on crop yields in China [@he2022marked].
