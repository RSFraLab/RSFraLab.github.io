Unsurprisingly, I hadn’t changed my website for more than 3 years and eveything became outdated. My group members, esp. Yiwei Mao, Yinon Bar-On and Alexis Renchon showed me new tools and suggested to use Quarto. Lots of nice examples from Affcom Lab , Crump Lab , and Gilmore Lab showed me it could be done and will save time eventually."

    "text": "Why Quarto?\nQuarto seems to be able to do many things I am interested in, not only rendering nice websites but also notebooks and code itself, esp. in Julia. What is most important to me in a website is that I can make more regular updates without changing HTML sites, change group members, keep track of alumni, provide news. The system of using MarkDown language and easy setup files looked quite appealing to me and we gave it a try."

You can also use email but slack is more convenient.\nWe should meet every 1-2 weeks. The PI will establish biweekly one-on-one meetings but please remind him if he fails to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Accessibility\n\nIf you have any equipment that would assist you in accessing the lab or performing any functions in the lab, please do not hesitate to purchase such equipment using lab funds. If it’s under $200, you can place the order on your own. If it’s greater than $200, please let Christian know before you make your purchase. This can be anything from ladders to specialized headphones to protect you from loud noises (e.g., if you have a noise sensitivity). If there is an issue with lab accessibility, don’t hesitate to bring it up.\n\nAccommodations for Disabilities\n\nFor additional accommodations for disabilities, the best resource is the Caltech Accessibility Services for Students (CASS) Office (https://cass.caltech.edu/).\n\nResources for Reporting Harassment\n\nFor issues in the lab that you do not wish to report to an institutional office, you can report issues directly to the PI or indirectly through a colleague/friend that you trust.\nIn serious cases of harassment, one option is to report incidents to the Equity and Title IX Office (https://titleix.caltech.edu/). There are several confidential resources on campus (https://equity.caltech.edu/reporting/reporting-options).\n\nResources for Diversity and Inclusion\n\nThe Caltech CCID is an excellent resource for questions about diversity and inclusion at the institute (http://diversity.caltech.edu/). There are also several programs through the CCID that may be of interest to students and staff.\nIn GPS, there is an active DEI committee to which students can submit anonymous comments (https://www.gps.caltech.edu/resources/dei-gps) or students can report anonymously to the DEI Liaisons (also listed on this website). You can also read their meeting minutes at that link as well.\n\nComputational Resources\n\nThe lab has several dedicated servers. More details about the computational infrastructure of the lab can be found in the Group GDocs\n\nTo get access to the servers, reach out to GPS Helpdesk (help-gps@caltech.edu). They might require Christians approval but they are quite responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected Work Schedule and Output\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected Work Hours\n\nThere are no hard expectations or rules for when/how many hours a student is expected to work each week. Feel free to work only as many hours as it takes to complete your work and prioritize progress on your PhD or project.\nWe recognize that everyone works best at different hours, and therefore there are no expectations for which specific hours of the day you choose to work.\n\nExpected Work Days\n\nThere are no expectations for which days of the week you choose to work (although please take ~2 days off of your choice every week - whether you take your weekend on the traditional Saturday/Sunday or on other days is up to you).\n\nHours of Communication\n\nFeel free to email others in the lab at any time during your personal working hours. However, note that members of the lab are not obligated to return emails over the weekend, and also note that other’s working hours may differ from your own.\nRespect that others will return your emails during their own working hours. If there is an emergency, please dial x5000 on campus to reach Campus Security for assistance.\n\nExpected Work Location\n\nIn general, there are no hard rules about where you are required to work on non-lab tasks. Consistent with Caltech HR rules, you may be able to work in whatever location is best for your working style and productivity, whether that be in the office, at home, or at a different location.\n\nExpected Research Outcomes\n\nOnce a year, students, postdocs, and staff will each have a meeting with your advisor about their professional goals and progress towards them, in which they will go over their goals for the year, their progress to their PhD, and any other topics relevant to their research and research outcomes. A short document prepared by the students / staff in advance helps initiate this yearly conversation about progress, expectations, career development, etc.\nYou may hear that students need a minimum of three papers published to graduate. This is generally the average number. Depending on your future career path, and the specifics of your project, the number of papers you publish before you graduate may vary. You’re encouraged, if you have any questions about this, to talk with Christian about your research progress.\n\nVacation\n\nIt is essential that everyone take breaks - this is an important part of maintaining one’s health and wellbeing. Under Caltech policy, all employees are guaranteed two weeks of paid holiday leave in addition to Institute holidays (the Institute holidays are listed here). If you feel that you need additional time off during the year, please take that time.\nIf you are planning to take time off, please let Christian know at least three weeks ahead of time, and let other relevant members know with plenty of warning so that schedules can be planned accordingly.\n\nPersonal Emergencies\n\nIf you need time off for a personal emergency (i.e. family emergency, mental health emergency, physical health emergency), please email Christian. There is no need to explain the situation in detail or share any personal information you do not wish to share - simply let him know that you have an emergency, and let him know once the emergency has passed."
