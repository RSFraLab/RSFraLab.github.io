    "title": "Monitoring Forest Water Content Using GPS Signals",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Forests play a crucial role in mitigating climate change by absorbing more than 20% of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission. However, such an absorption is constrained by forest water content, owing to the carbon-water nexus. Continuous monitoring of forest water content is important as it changes dramatically across diurnal to seasonal scales, which is not feasible with traditional labor-intensive approaches. Spaceborne satellite products of Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD), an emerging plant water content metric, only offer observations at two times of the day, which still fails to capture the variations of water content over the course of the day. To address this issue, we recently developed a new method of monitoring plant water content with a sub-hourly resolution using the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). It measures the signal attenuation of GNSS L-band microwave signals by water in the forest canopy by deploying a pair of signal receivers above and below the trees, which is similar to the differential positioning technique. For the first time, we can capture the diurnal variation of plant water content, and it does not require any expensive instruments. This technology offers a low-cost, robust, and high-temporally resolved solution of obtaining plant water dynamics, which potentially has implications for agriculture, ecology, and environmental science, and is particularly significant to the pursuit of carbon neutrality goals. This work has been published in the Geophysical Research Letters (doi: 10.1029/2023GL107121)."

We recommend more deployments of these promising, lower-cost yet robust instruments at existing flux tower sites. This will provide complementary measurements to assess carbon and water fluxes, effectively bridging the gap in our understanding of vegetation water content and its temporal dynamics. Such VOD observations are at the same temporal resolutions as flux measurements and align well with the flux footprint."

    "title": "Improve canopy radiative transfer and electron transport modeling",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Quantifying canopy radiative transfer (RT) is crucial for modeling all the subsequent processes, such as canopy energy balance and leaf photosynthesis. The most widely used canopy RT schemes in current vegetation and land surface models are the two-stream scheme reported by Sellers and the scheme described by Campbell and Norman, both of which dated back to the 1980s (maybe even earlier). These schemes use two broad bands to represent the continuous solar radiation spectra: photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, some also use visible light) and near-infrared radiation (NIR). As plants generally absorb more PAR than NIR (even the green light absorption is higher than NIR), using a constant approximation for PAR seems okay in the old days given the limitation in computation resources and lack of knowledge on how plant traits impact the absorption ratio.\nNevertheless, there are some well-recognized problems in the broadband models, particularly for natural radiation:\n\nLight source difference along the vertical canopy. For example, plants absorb more red and blue light compared to green light; as a result, the red and blue light fraction would decrease in the lower canopy, and the effective absorption ratio should decrease in the lower canopy.\nLight partitioning within the leaf. Not all PAR absorbed by leaf contributes to photosynthesis, as water, leaf biomass, and pigments other than chlorophyll also absorb PAR photons (Fig. 1). Therefore, only the photons absorbed by chlorophyll and some carotenoid should be counted as PPAR (PAR that goes to photosystems; Fig. 1).\nPhoton partitioning in the photosystems. Photons in the photosystems have four fates: heat dissipation, non-photochemical quenching, photochemical quenching, and fluorescence. A rate coefficient is associated with each fate, namely Kd, Kn, Kp, and Kf. These rate coefficients might also be temperature-dependent.\n\n\n\n\nFig. 1 Absorption coefficients of main leaf constitutes and chlorophyll content’s impact on \\(f_\\text{APAR} \\cdot f_\\text{APAR}\\).\n\n\nIf we consider the photon absorption and electron transport as a series of partitioning problems, we have \\[\nJ_\\text{PSII} = \\text{PAR} \\cdot f_\\text{APAR} \\cdot f_\\text{PPAR} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{K_\\text{pmax}}{K_\\text{d} + K_\\text{n} + K_\\text{pmax} + K_\\text{f}},\n\\] where\n\n\\(J_\\text{PSII}\\): maximum photons that go to photosystem II,\n\\(\\text{PAR}\\): Incoming PAR in photons;\n\\(f_\\text{APAR}\\): Fraction of PAR absorbed by the leaf (\\(\\text{APAR} = \\text{PAR} \\cdot f_\\text{APAR}\\));\n\\(f_\\text{PPAR}\\): Fraction of APAR absorbed by chlorophyll (and some carotenoid; \\(\\text{PPAR} = \\text{APAR} \\cdot f_\\text{PPAR}\\));\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\): Fraction of PPAR that goes to photosystem II;\n\\(K_\\text{pmax}\\): Maximum rate constant for photochemical quenching;\n\\(K_\\text{d}\\): Rate constant for heat dissipation;\n\\(K_\\text{n}\\): Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) rate constant (default is 0 unless sustained NPQ exists);\n\\(K_\\text{f}\\): Rate constant for fluorescence;\n\nIn this simplified equation,\n\nPAR varies along the vertical canopy, and changes with canopy structure and leaf traits;\n\\(f_\\text{APAR}\\) is plant trait-dependent, such as chlorophyll content;\n\\(f_\\text{PPAR}\\) is also trait-dependent, such as chlorophyll content;\n\\(K_\\text{d}\\) is likely temperature-dependent;\nSustained NPQ and thus residual \\(K_\\text{n}\\) are temperature-dependent.\n\nHowever, none of these has been explicitly accounted for in the traditional land surface models, which adopt broadband RT schemes. As we now have more complicated and powerful RT models and an increasing amount of plant trait data, it would be a good opportunity to move forward and use the more accurate hyperspectral canopy RT scheme in future modeling practice. When examining how the use of hyperspectral and broadband RT schemes may impact global simulation results, we found that the globally integrated GPP may differ by 8% while the grid level difference may be &gt; 20%. For a thorough analysis, please refer to the published paper.\nGiven the substantial impacts, we highly recommend other land surface models use a hyperspectral RT scheme in their future model versions. Or at least some corrections need to be made to account for the plant traits- and light source-related changes in \\(f_\\text{APAR}\\) and \\(f_\\text{PPAR}\\). Please refer to our published paper for the correction methods we proposed in the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems."

You can also use email but slack is more convenient.\nWe should meet every 1-2 weeks. The PI will establish biweekly one-on-one meetings but please remind him if he fails to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Accessibility\n\nIf you have any equipment that would assist you in accessing the lab or performing any functions in the lab, please do not hesitate to purchase such equipment using lab funds. If it’s under $200, you can place the order on your own. If it’s greater than $200, please let Christian know before you make your purchase. This can be anything from ladders to specialized headphones to protect you from loud noises (e.g., if you have a noise sensitivity). If there is an issue with lab accessibility, don’t hesitate to bring it up.\n\nAccommodations for Disabilities\n\nFor additional accommodations for disabilities, the best resource is the Caltech Accessibility Services for Students (CASS) Office (https://cass.caltech.edu/).\n\nResources for Reporting Harassment\n\nFor issues in the lab that you do not wish to report to an institutional office, you can report issues directly to the PI or indirectly through a colleague/friend that you trust.\nIn serious cases of harassment, one option is to report incidents to the Equity and Title IX Office (https://titleix.caltech.edu/). There are several confidential resources on campus (https://equity.caltech.edu/reporting/reporting-options).\n\nResources for Diversity and Inclusion\n\nThe Caltech CCID is an excellent resource for questions about diversity and inclusion at the institute (http://diversity.caltech.edu/). There are also several programs through the CCID that may be of interest to students and staff.\nIn GPS, there is an active DEI committee to which students can submit anonymous comments (https://www.gps.caltech.edu/resources/dei-gps) or students can report anonymously to the DEI Liaisons (also listed on this website). You can also read their meeting minutes at that link as well.\n\nComputational Resources\n\nThe lab has several dedicated servers. More details about the computational infrastructure of the lab can be found in the Group GDocs\n\nTo get access to the servers, reach out to GPS Helpdesk (help-gps@caltech.edu). They might require Christians approval but they are quite responsive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected Work Schedule and Output\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected Work Hours\n\nThere are no hard expectations or rules for when/how many hours a student is expected to work each week. Feel free to work only as many hours as it takes to complete your work and prioritize progress on your PhD or project.\nWe recognize that everyone works best at different hours, and therefore there are no expectations for which specific hours of the day you choose to work.\n\nExpected Work Days\n\nThere are no expectations for which days of the week you choose to work (although please take ~2 days off of your choice every week - whether you take your weekend on the traditional Saturday/Sunday or on other days is up to you).\n\nHours of Communication\n\nFeel free to email others in the lab at any time during your personal working hours. However, note that members of the lab are not obligated to return emails over the weekend, and also note that other’s working hours may differ from your own.\nRespect that others will return your emails during their own working hours. If there is an emergency, please dial x5000 on campus to reach Campus Security for assistance.\n\nExpected Work Location\n\nIn general, there are no hard rules about where you are required to work on non-lab tasks. Consistent with Caltech HR rules, you may be able to work in whatever location is best for your working style and productivity, whether that be in the office, at home, or at a different location.\n\nExpected Research Outcomes\n\nOnce a year, students, postdocs, and staff will each have a meeting with your advisor about their professional goals and progress towards them, in which they will go over their goals for the year, their progress to their PhD, and any other topics relevant to their research and research outcomes. A short document prepared by the students / staff in advance helps initiate this yearly conversation about progress, expectations, career development, etc.\nYou may hear that students need a minimum of three papers published to graduate. This is generally the average number. Depending on your future career path, and the specifics of your project, the number of papers you publish before you graduate may vary. You’re encouraged, if you have any questions about this, to talk with Christian about your research progress.\n\nVacation\n\nIt is essential that everyone take breaks - this is an important part of maintaining one’s health and wellbeing. Under Caltech policy, all employees are guaranteed two weeks of paid holiday leave in addition to Institute holidays (the Institute holidays are listed here). If you feel that you need additional time off during the year, please take that time.\nIf you are planning to take time off, please let Christian know at least three weeks ahead of time, and let other relevant members know with plenty of warning so that schedules can be planned accordingly.\n\nPersonal Emergencies\n\nIf you need time off for a personal emergency (i.e. family emergency, mental health emergency, physical health emergency), please email Christian. There is no need to explain the situation in detail or share any personal information you do not wish to share - simply let him know that you have an emergency, and let him know once the emergency has passed."

    "text": "Carbon-I\n\nCarbon-I is our response to NASA’s ESE call, it can be considered a merger of the philosophies behind the original OCO mission and the high resolution mapping approaches that are now followed by EMIT, GHGSat, CarbonMapper, MethaneSat and others. We are eagerly awaiting a decision from NASA in April and are ready to hit the ground running. What could Carbon-I bring to the table? The combination of high spatial resolution and high enough spectral resolution for trace gas mapping solves two problems:\n\nWe will obtain enough data in the tropics, which has been a major problem for OCO-2, TROPOMI and other missions, mostly because shallow cumulus clouds have cloud gaps that are much smaller than the footprint size of current greenhouse gas sensors. This leads to periods of data drought in the humid tropics Pre-print paper: \nIt will avoid surface interferences, that plagues high-spatial-resolution mappers with coarse spectral resolution.\n\nWe have a great team and are doing something different with Carbon-I. The greenhouse gas remote sensing field is getting crowded, both on the agency side targetting high accuracy for flux inversions (OCO-2, OCO-3, GOSAT, GOSAT-2, GOSAT-GW, TROPOMI, Sentinel-5, CO2M, etc) as well as the plume mapping side to provide actionable results (EMIT, GHGSat, MethaneSat, CarbonMapper). Carbon-I aims to tackle the issue those missions can’t resolve by merging their advantages…"
