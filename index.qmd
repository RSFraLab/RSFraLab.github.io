### Our group studies the global carbon cycle using a variety of tools:

- We leverage the vantage point in space to globally observe the Earth, using remote sensing for atmospheric trace gases and surface properties.
- Not only do we use higher-level satellite products (i.e., L2 and above), but we also generate our own data from spectral measurements.
- Our data sources include OCO-2, TROPOMI, EMIT, ECOSTRESS, GRACE, MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-2, among others.
- We use and develop land surface models to study global carbon cycles and their dominant drivers.
- We connect remote sensing and modeling such that models can directly learn from space-based data (as part of [CliMA](https://clima.caltech.edu/)).
- We perform field and leaf-level measurements, which include our spectrally resolved Pulse Amplitude Modulated Chlorophyll Fluorescence measurements and PhotoSpec, a novel system for measuring Chlorophyll Fluorescence at Fluxtower sites.
